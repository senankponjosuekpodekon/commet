## Project: Commet (Web application for managing comments on everything online)

### Introduction

#### Project presentation**

This project is an initiative aimed at setting up a web platform that brings together all the world's Internet communities around the same goal: **Comment everything**; give your opinion, on everything, from any corner of the Internet. This platform, called "Commet", should thus become a reference in terms of web applications allowing users to comment on any content found on the Internet and to share these comments with the Commet community. The goal is to decentralize comments from social networks and provide a new participatory vision of the web, by bringing together communities around websites.

#### Project Goal

The main goal of the “**Commet**” project is to centralize the opinions of Internet communities regarding the content available on the Internet: **Commet** allows Internet users to give an opinion on any referenceable content and share them with the Commet community. It targets people aged between 13 and 35.

#### Constraints and Limitations

### Architecture and technologies

#### System architecture

The system architecture for the "**Commet**" platform will be based on a modern three-tier structure, which will include:

**1\. Presentation layer:** This layer will be responsible for the user interface, providing users with a user-friendly way to interact with the platform. It will be developed using the **Vue Js** framework, which will allow creating rich, interactive and responsive interfaces.

**2\. Logic layer:** This layer will be used to manage the logic of the platform. It will include key features such as adding a comment, sub-comments, registrations, and verifications. This layer will be developed using **Laravel**, which will allow creating a scalable and performant web application.

**3\. Data layer:** The data layer will consist of a **MySQL** relational database. It will store all the information related to comments, users. The database will be designed to ensure fast data retrieval and efficient communication management.

#### Technologies used

**1\. Vue Js:** The **Vue Js** framework will be used to develop the user interface of the **Commet** platform. **Vue Js** offers a modular structure, great flexibility, and a large ecosystem of libraries for building rich web applications.

**2\. Laravel: Laravel** will be used to create the business logic layer of the platform. Vuejs is known for its speed and scalability, making it ideal for managing real-time actions, such as managing registrations and comments.

**3\. MySQL Database: MySQL** will be the database of choice to store the platform's essential data. This will ensure efficient data management and high performance.

**4\. Hosting and Infrastructure:** The "**Commet**" platform will be hosted on scalable cloud servers, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure, to ensure easy scalability in case of scaling.

**5\. Security:** The platform will be implemented with advanced security practices, including the use of **SSL** certificates for secure connections, management of access credentials, and encryption of sensitive data.

**6\. Performance:** Performance optimizations will be implemented to ensure fast loading times and a smooth user experience, even under heavy usage.

**7\. Multilingual Support:** The technologies used will support multiple languages ​​to meet the needs of international and multilingual events.

### User Interface Design Wireframes and Mockups

The user interface design of "**Commet**" plays a vital role in creating an intuitive and engaging user experience. To achieve this goal, we plan to develop wireframes and mockups for the main pages of the platform. These visual elements help guide the development of the user interface and ensure visual consistency throughout the application.

**1\. Homepage:** A mockup of the homepage will be developed to give visitors a general overview of the platform. This page will highlight the comments already made by users, and calls to action to encourage users to explore further.

**2\. Comment creation page:** Users will be given access to a mockup of the comment creation page. This mockup will guide users through the comment creation process by specifying the required information and the available customization options.

**3\. Online registration page:** Participants will be guided by a mockup of the online registration page. This mockup will include a clear and user-friendly registration form to collect participant information, as well as sections to log in directly or change your password.

**4\. User Management Page:** A mockup of the user management page will be developed to allow administrators to view and manage the list of users registered on the site. This mockup includes features to edit, add, delete a user.

### Visual Design

In addition to wireframes and mockups, the visual design of "**Commet**" will be carefully crafted to reflect the visual identity of the company **DigitAQK**. Visual elements, such as colors, fonts, icons, logos, and images, will be harmoniously integrated to create an aesthetic and engaging user interface.

### Cross-platform Resolution

The user interface of "**Commet**" will be designed with cross-platform resolution in mind. This will ensure an optimal user experience on a variety of devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. The interface will be adaptive to automatically adjust to different screen sizes and orientations.

### Accessibility
Accessibility will be a major concern when designing the user interface. Universal design principles will be applied to ensure that the platform is accessible to all, including users with special needs, such as
people with visual impairments or mobility challenges.

### Usability testing
Before the platform is deployed, usability testing will be conducted to assess the usability of the user interface. Target users will participate in testing and provide feedback to identify necessary improvements.

### Revisions and iterations
The user interface design will be revised and iterated based on user feedback and adjustments as needed to ensure an optimal experience.
